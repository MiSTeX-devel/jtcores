Prepare a MAME trace file with register dumps, and a VCD file with the registers
you want to compare.

debug.trace		text file generated with MAME
debug.vcd		VCD file for comparison

File names cannot be overriden.

An automatic matching  between the MAME variables and the VCD signal names will
be attempted. If a signal is not matched to MAME, manually add it with the alias
command.

The comparison is interactive, although a script can also be run to help in
debugging sessions. Type help to obtain the list of commands.
