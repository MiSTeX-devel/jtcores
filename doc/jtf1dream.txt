JTF1Dream FPGA clone of F1 Dream arcade faithful to original hardware
=====================================================================

Please, read the main README file too.

You have just got an expensive $200 PCB as this is the price I paid for it. 
You have in your hands a faithful conversion of the circuits on the F1 Dream PCB to FPGA.
If you come from the emulation world here are some of the things different from emulators:

-Real CPU/GPU bus sharing with delays
-Sprites handled with DMA exactly as in the original hardware
-MCU/CPU interaction with same bus timings as original hardware
-Graphics priority handled by the original PROM
-No lag between image and input. Data is being sent to the screen in real time.
-Sound sampling rate: 41.663 kHz (original, 125/3 kHz)
-Accurate FPS 100% same as real hardware

These technical aspects mean that the game play will be different from an emulator
in a number of ways and that some hardware tricks that were not emulated will work
here as in the original hardware.

GAME PLAY
=========

The game uses two buttons: low gear and high gear. In turbo mode you press the two
at the same time to set the turbo.

Note that by default the continue prompt is disabled. If you want to
be able to continue, change this in the OSD. You can then save your settings
so it will be the same the next time you powerup.

TEST SCREEN
===========
Select the test screen through the OSD menu.  To pass on to the next test 
screen press both action buttons.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
=====================
-This board seems to be the same as Tiger Road but it has the MCU socket filled
 whereas Tiger Road didn't have one. On the other hand, it has no chips in the
 sockets for the second Z80 and its ROM. It should be possible to convert an
 original Tiger Road board into a F1 Dream board and vice versa quite easily.
-YM2203 phi M =3.7MHz

REVISION HISTORY
================
17 Nov 2019: Beta release (MiST and MiSTer)
